# 👋 Hey, I'm Adarsh Vinayak

**Creative Technologist • Product Thinker • AI Explorer**

Welcome to my world of experiments at the intersection of **AI, data, storytelling, and imagination**. I love building systems that are not only functional but also *fun*, *human*, and *intelligent*.

## 🚀 What I Do

- 🧠 **AI & Data Projects**  
  I build intelligent systems with real-world applications — from **RAG-powered apps**, **voice agents**, and **LLM integrations** to full-fledged **e-commerce and matchmaking platforms**.

- 🧑‍💻 **Full-stack Dev**  
  React + Next.js + Supabase is my home base. I'm currently building platforms like **SuperNetworkAI** (smart networking) and **Brandomatic** (AI ad generator using ChatGPT Vision).

- 🎨 **Creative Tech & Media**  
  3D artist 🧊 | Video editor 🎬 | Designer 🎨 | Avatar + voice experiments using **LiveKit**, **Heygen**, **Tavus**, and **ComfyUI + LoRAs**.

- 💡 **Product Thinking**  
  I don’t just code — I **design systems**, think in **modules**, **optimize workflows**, and love solving tough UX problems.
